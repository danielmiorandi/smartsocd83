This report briefly describes the first version of the SmartSociety platform. 

The SmartSociety platform integrates the instantiation of the components designed and developed by the Consortium members within the framework of the technical workpackages WP2-WP7. 

The report at hand includes a set of revised architectural diagrams, developed by the Consortium building upon the results in Deliverable D8.1. The revised architecture is now fully aligned with the specification of components as developed within WP2-WP7, and has been developed according to the high-level requirements identified in WP1 and further analysed in D8.1.

The report then describes the interfaces of the platform components integrated up to M24 (the peer manager, the orchestration manager and the communication middleware, which includes connectors to end users). The platform runtime is then presented.

Two applications (SmartShare and AskSmartSociety!) are used to illustrate how the platform components interoperate to provide the required functionality.

The report concludes with a roadmap detailing the integration milestones for the third year of project activitie and the plans for focus experiments enabled by the platform.
